\title{Annotations of Human Entrez Genes (EG) by Human Phenotype Phenotypic Abnormality (HPPA).}


\usage{
data(org.Hs.egHPPA)
}

\description{
An R object that contains associations between Human Phenotype
Phenotypic Abnormality terms and Human Entrez Genes. This data is first
prepared based on
\url{http://compbio.charite.de/svn/hpo/trunk/src/ontology/human-phenotype-ontology.obo}
and
\url{http://compbio.charite.de/hudson/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastStableBuild/artifact/annotation/ALL_SOURCES_ALL_FREQUENCIES_genes_to_phenotype.txt}.
}

\value{
an object of class "GS", a list with following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{set_info}: a matrix of nSet X 4 containing gene set
information, where nSet is the number of gene sets (i.e. HPPA terms),
and the 4 columns are "setID" (i.e. "Term ID"), "name" (i.e. "Term
Name"), "namespace" and "distance"}
\item{\code{gs}: a list of gene sets, each storing gene members
thereof. Always, gene sets are identified by "setID" and gene members
identified by "Entrez ID"}
}
