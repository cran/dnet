\title{Human Phenotype Phenotypic Abnormality (HPPA).}


\usage{
data(ig.HPPA)
}

\description{
An R object that contains information on Human Phenotype Phenotypic
Abnormality terms. These terms are organised as a direct acyclic graph
(DAG), which is further stored as an object of the class 'igraph' (see
\url{http://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph-package.html}). This data is
prepared based on \url{http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo}.
}

\value{
an object of class "igraph". As a direct graph, it has attributes to
vertices/nodes and edges:
\itemize{
\item{\code{vertex attributes}: "name" (i.e. "Term ID"), "term_id"
(i.e. "Term ID"), "term_name" (i.e "Term Name") and "term_distance"
(i.e. Term Distance: the distance to the root; always 0 for the root
itself)}
\item{\code{edge attributes}: "relation" (either 'is_a' or 'part_of')}
}
