\title{Function to view enrichment results in a sample-specific manner}
\usage{
dGSEAview(eTerm, which_sample = 1, top_num = 10,
sortBy = c("adjp", "gadjp", "ES", "nES", "pvalue", "FWER", "FDR",
"qvalue"),
decreasing = NULL, details = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{eTerm}{an object of class "eTerm"}

\item{which_sample}{which sample will be viewed}

\item{top_num}{the maximum number of gene sets will be
viewed}

\item{sortBy}{which statistics will be used for sorting
and viewing gene sets. It can be "adjp" for adjusted p
value, "gadjp" for globally adjusted p value, "ES" for
enrichment score, "nES" for normalised enrichment score,
"pvalue" for p value, "FWER" for family-wise error rate,
"FDR" for false discovery rate, "qvalue" for q value}

\item{decreasing}{logical to indicate whether to sort in
a decreasing order. If it is null, it would be true for
"ES" or "nES"; otherwise it would be false}

\item{details}{logical to indicate whether the detail
information of gene sets is also viewed. By default, it
sets to false for no inclusion}
}
\value{
a data frame with following components: \itemize{
\item{\code{setID}: term ID} \item{\code{ES}: enrichment
score} \item{\code{nES}: normalised enrichment score}
\item{\code{pvalue}: nominal p value} \item{\code{adjp}:
adjusted p value} \item{\code{gadjp}: globally adjusted p
value} \item{\code{FDR}: false discovery rate}
\item{\code{qvalue}: q value} \item{\code{setSize}: the
number of genes in the set; optional, it is only appended
when "details" is true} \item{\code{name}: term name;
optional, it is only appended when "details" is true}
\item{\code{namespace}: term namespace; optional, it is
only appended when "details" is true}
\item{\code{distance}: term distance; optional, it is
only appended when "details" is true} }
}
\description{
\code{dGSEAview} is supposed to view results of gene set
enrichment analysis but for a specific sample.
