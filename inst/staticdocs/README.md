## Features

* Identification of gene-active networks from high-throughput omics data (eg [expression](http://supfam.org/dnet/demo-Fang.html), [mutation](http://supfam.org/dnet/demo-TCGA.html) and [replication timing](http://supfam.org/dnet/demo-Hiratani.html));
* Network-based sample classifications and visualisations on 2D sample landscape;
* Random Walk with Restart for network affinity calculation;
* Semantic similarity between ontology terms (and between their annotated genes);
* Enrichment analysis using a variety of built-in databases;
* A wide variety of built-in [RData](http://supfam.org/dnet/rdata.html): ontologies (including `Gene Ontology`, `Disease Ontology`, `Human Phenotype` and `Mammalian Phenotype`), gene evolutionary age information and gene association networks in well-studied organisms (including human, mouse, rat, chicken, c.elegans, fruitfly, zebrafish and arabidopsis);
* Support for high-performance parallel computing;
* A tool with rich visuals but less inputs, which can run on `Windows`, `Mac` and `Linux`.
