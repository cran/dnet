## Introduction

`dnet` is an open-source R package for analysing biological networks and high-throughput biological data in an integrative manner.

`dnet` intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with dynamic information such as expression levels across samples.

`dnet` aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool for network-based sample stratifications.

## Features

* An integrated framework for integration of network and expression information for classifying/stratifying samples
* Identification of expression-active dynamic subnetworks
* Network-based sample stratifications 
* Visualisations of network-based sample stratifications on 2D landscape
* This package can run on `Windows`, `Mac` and `Linux`
