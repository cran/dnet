# <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#F87217; text-decoration:underline">These built-in data are the backend of various analytical utilities supported in the dnet package, spanning a wide range of the known gene-centric knowledge across well-studied organisms.</span> They are provided as RData-formatted files which are regularly updated. Also, we will populate them by adding new knowledge, for example, upon request by users. The built-in RData are summarised in brief and available in the <a href="http://supfam.org/dnet/rdata.html">RData</a> page.

# Usually, the users do not need to download them by self for use. Instead, the users are encouraged to understand what they want to use by simply looking up the keywords in the <a href="http://supfam.org/dnet/docs.html">Documentations</a> page. The package has functions to import them or deal with them directly.

# <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#F87217; text-decoration:underline">The function dRDataLoader allows the users to import what they want to use.</span>

# <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#F87217; text-decoration:underline">For the ease to use, organism-specific data start with 'org', followed by the specific organim ('Hs' for human), and the data content: only 'eg' means information about Entrez Genes, and further appendix (for example, 'GOBP') means information about their annotations by Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP).</span>
